# Strategies-for-Scaling-Up-RL-Based-Multiplier-Architectures-to-Higher-Bit-widths
Digital multiplication algorithms are typically developed through inflexible procedures, which restricts the discovery of alternative architectures tailored to particular constraints or specialized use cases. In contrast, a reinforcement learning–driven method enables automated exploration of the design space for digital multiplication algorithms.

The aforementioned procedure can be carried out by making an agent engage with an environment framed as a sequential decision-making task, thus acquiring strategies that produce functional architectures with less than 10\% error, without depending on predefined multiplication rules. The computing resources for this task grow rapidly as the input bits augment due to the exponential nature of the possible multiplications ($2^{2n}$ with two n bit inputs), making the automated design space exploration difficult to scale up.

This work proposes three combinational strategies to scale up 2 bit inexact array multipliers architectures that were automatically obtained through Reinforcement Learning techniques up to 8 bit multipliers, allowing a partial exploration of the design space without the vast computational expenses needed for a Reinforcement Learning counterpart. Furthermore, the relevance of the proposed approach is demonstrated through the implementation of Gaussian filters in SystemVerilog, where the scaled multipliers are converted from Verilog into modules integrated as the core arithmetic components of the filters. This application highlights not only the feasibility of the scaling methodology but also its potential for advancing efficient hardware implementations in digital signal processing.
